# Insights Product Strategy - Power BI
In this Data Analysis project, I have studied a dataset related to the banking domain for product strategy. Mitron Bank is one of the prominent financial institutions in the industry. I have analyzed their customer's spending patterns, income levels, and spending by payment types as per their demographies, gender, marital status, and occupations. And, I created a Power BI dashboard for Data Visualization.
This project is a part of [Codebasics](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge) Resume Project challenge #8: Provide Insights to the Product Strategy Team in the Banking Domain

## Problem statement

Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market. 

AtliQ Data Services came to know about this through an internal link and approached Mitron Bank with a proposal to implement this project. However, the strategy director of Mitron Bank, Mr. Bashnir Rover is skeptical and asked them to do a pilot project with the sample data before handing over the full project. They provided a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities on their online spending and other details. 

As a data analyst, my role is to analyze the provided sample data and report key findings to the strategy team of Mitron Bank. This analysis is expected to guide them in tailoring the credit cards to customer needs and market trends. 
The successful acquisition of this project depends on my ability to provide actionable, data-driven recommendations and impress Mr. Bashnir Rover & his team.

### Task List

## Learnt things from this Project 
- I Learned, how to use bookmarks and selection for different purposes. (Page navigation and a clear filter button in the dashboard were achieved using bookmarks and selection same as a website page navigation.
- Tried using the color palette and sticking with those colors throughout the dashboard ([Color palette link](https://colorhunt.co/palette/0766ad29adb2c5e898f3f3f3))
